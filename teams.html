        <h2>Teams</h2>
		The NBA (National Basketball Association) is made up of 30 teams, divided into two conferences, Eastern and Western. The teams are further divided into six divisions, with five teams in each. The Eastern Conference includes the Atlantic, Central, and Southeast Divisions, while the Western Conference includes the Northwest, Pacific, and Southwest Divisions. Each team has a unique history and identity, with their own star players and fan bases. From the legendary Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers to the up-and-coming Charlotte Hornets and Memphis Grizzlies, every team brings their own flavor to the NBA. The league is known for its athleticism, skill, and passion, and each team strives to compete for the ultimate prize, the NBA championship.
